# Welcome to Markdown Software Bill Of Materials's documentation!

**MdBOM** is a Python CLI tool which allows you to take a
Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) file as ``.json`` and generate
a markdown page presenting it in a more human friendly way.

If you want to see an example, you can check out the [3rd Party](./3rd-party.md)
